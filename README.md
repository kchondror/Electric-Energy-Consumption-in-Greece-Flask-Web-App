## Repository Overview: Development of a Clustering System Based on Energy Consumption Footprint <br>
This repository encompasses all the source code files created during the execution of my thesis project titled "Development of a Clustering System Based on Energy Consumption Footprint." The culmination of these files contributes to the functionality of a web-based application, meticulously crafted using the Flask library and adhering to the principles of REST technology.<br>

When users navigate through the system, they have the option to explore four distinct web pages. The first page furnishes essential information about the application's purpose. Subsequently, the next two pages prompt users to input details about their residence. Finally, the last page showcases the results derived from the analysis conducted using the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

### Front-End Technologies:
The front end of the application leverages the following technologies:

1. **HTML**
2. **CSS/Bootstrap 5**
3. **JavaScript**
These technologies collectively shape the user interface, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for individuals interacting with the application.

### Back-End Technologies:
The back end of the application relies on Python, coupled with its scientific libraries:

1. **Scikit-Learn (Sk-Learn)** 
2. **Pandas - Numpy**
3. Integration with a **MongoDB** database facilitated through the PyMongo library

This robust technological stack enables efficient data processing, analysis, and storage. The combination of front-end and back-end technologies results in a comprehensive and effective clustering system tailored to analyze energy consumption footprints.
